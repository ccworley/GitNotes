github tips


First do a 
>git status
to see if anything odd is happening.

> to ensure remote version is most up-to-date use
git pull origin master
where origin is the remote master version, and master is the web master version.

> make changes to origin - this is your master by the way.
If you don’t want to change your local version then checkout another local version to work on.


Then

if https: doesn’t work after a password change force it to let you enter your password with

git push -u origin master
