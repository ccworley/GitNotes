github tips


First do a 
>git status
to see if anything odd is happening.

> to ensure remote version is most up-to-date use
git pull origin master
where origin is the remote master version, and master is the web master version.

> make changes to origin - this is your master by the way.
If you donâ€™t want to change your local version then checkout another local version to work on.

Use 
>git add filename 
or 
>git add * 
to capture any changes after a session.

Use
>git rm filename
 to remove from filesystem and github but it will be inthe github history
 
To put a folder in the github create the folder and put a file in it, or github won't track it.
Also it won't track symlinks so needs to be the original folder.
Then use
>git add Folder/*

Then use 
>git commit -m "comment" 
to commit the changes
Then use 
>git push origin master 
to push the changes to the master on github.

The error 403 is to do with using HTTPS on a server system.
Use ssh instead but you need to add the public rsa key. Follow these instructions:
https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/

If you change your github password for HTTPS you need to force it to let you enter the new password.
You can do this when doing a push using the -u argument:
git push -u origin master
